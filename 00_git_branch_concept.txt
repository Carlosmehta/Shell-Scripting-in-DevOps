Explanation of Git Branches (Using the Road Analogy)
Main Branch (main):

Think of this as the highway—it's the stable, official version of your project.

Everyone uses this road to go to production.

Feature Branches:

These are side roads created to build or test new features.

You can build and test here without messing up the main highway.

Benefits:

You can develop safely.

You can test and throw away code without affecting others.

Multiple people can work on different features simultaneously.



main:  o──●──●──●──●──●──●
                 \      
feature:          ●──●─●  
                   
    

main: Stable project

feature1: A separate path for testing or building new things

main:     o──●──●──●──●──●  ← main branch
                 \      /
feature:          ●──●─●   ← feature branch

When you run:

git checkout main
git merge feature

You're telling Git:

 "Hey, bring all the work done in feature into main."
